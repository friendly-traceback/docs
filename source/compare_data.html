<h5>Different explanation - by Friendly-traceback</h5>
<pre class='highlight friendly-small-pre'><b>3.7: </b>You likely called a function using the Python keyword `True` as an argument:

    a_function(True=something) 

which Python interpreted as trying to assign a value to a Python keyword.

You cannot assign a value to `True`.

<b>3.8: </b>`True` is a constant in Python; you cannot assign it a different value.
