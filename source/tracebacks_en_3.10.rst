Friendly tracebacks - in English
======================================

Friendly aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
Below, we can find some examples. SyntaxError cases, as well as TabError and
IndentationError cases, are shown in a separate page.
Not all cases handled by friendly are included here.

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     `trb_english.py` located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.

Friendly-traceback version: 0.7.49
Python version: 3.10.6
