Friendly SyntaxError tracebacks - in English
=============================================

Friendly aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
This file contains only examples of SyntaxError and its sub-classes.
Some tests may appear to be repetitive to a human reader
but they are may be included to ensure more complete test coverage.

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     `trb_syntax_english.py` located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.
     On Windows, if Sphinx is installed on your computer, it is suggested
     instead to run make_trb.bat in the root directory as it will create
     similar files for all languages *and* update the documentation.

    A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file
    'TESTS:\syntax\and_in_import_statement.py'

    The Python keyword `and` can only be used for boolean expressions.
    Perhaps you meant to write
    
    `from math import sin , cos`

(4) Incorrect use of 'from module import ... as ...

       2: from math import (sin, cos) as funcs
                                      ^^

    I am guessing that you are trying to import at least one object
    from module `math` and rename it using the Python keyword `as`;
    this keyword can only be used to rename one object at a time
    using a well defined syntax.
    I suggest that you split up any such import statement with each object
    renamed on a separate line as follows:
    
        from math import object_1 as name_1
        from math import object_2 as name_2  # if needed
    

(5) Assign instead of equal (or walrus).

                 ^

    You likely used an assignment operator `=` instead of an equality operator `==`.
    The following statement would not contain a syntax error:
    
        a = (b == 2)  # issue #65

    and use the wrong order for a condition.
    The correct order depends if there is an `else` clause or not.
    For example, the correct order for a list comprehensions with
    condition can be either
    
        [f(x) if condition else other for x in sequence]  # 'if' before 'for'
    
    or, if there is no `else`
    
        [f(x) for x in sequence if condition]  # 'if' after 'for'

    It looks like you used an invalid character (`g`) in an hexadecimal number.
    
    Hexadecimal numbers are base 16 integers that use the symbols `0` to `9`
    to represent values 0 to 9, and the letters `a` to `f` (or `A` to `F`)
    to represent values 10 to 15.
    In Python, hexadecimal numbers start with either `0x` or `0X`,
    followed by the characters used to represent the value of that integer.

    A for loop must have the form:

    where `...` must contain only identifiers (variable names)
    and not literals like `"char"`.

    Python indicates that the error is caused by `b` written immediately after `a`.
    Perhaps you meant to insert an operator like `+; -; *; ,`
    between `a` and `b`.
    The following lines of code would not cause any `SyntaxError`:
    
        python = a +  b
        python = a -  b
        python = a *  b
        python = a,  b
    Note: these are just some of the possible choices and that
    some of them might raise other types of exceptions.

    I suspect that you were trying to use a quote character inside a string
    that was enclosed in quotes of the same kind.
    Perhaps you should have escaped the inner quote character:
    
        message = 'I don\'t mind.'

    SyntaxError: trailing comma not allowed without surrounding parentheses
    
        Did you write a comma by mistake?
        
    A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file
    'TESTS:\syntax\trailing_comma_in_import.py'
    at the location indicated.

                           ^^^

    Python indicates that you need to surround an expression
    ending with a comma by parentheses.
    However, if you remove the last comma, there will be no syntax error.
    Perhaps you meant to write
    
    `from math import sin, cos`

    You wrote three equal signs in a row which is allowed in some
    programming languages, but not in Python. To check if two objects
    are equal, use two equal signs, `==`; to see if two names represent
    the exact same object, use the operator `is`.

    It looks like you tried to use a starred expression as a dict value;
    this is not allowed.

    A `TabError` indicates that you have used both spaces
    and tab characters to indent your code.
    This is not allowed in Python.
    Indenting your code means to have block of codes aligned vertically
    by inserting either spaces or tab characters at the beginning of lines.
    Python's recommendation is to always use spaces to indent your code.

    SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
    
        Did you forget to escape a backslash character?
        
    A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file

    You started writing a string with a single or double quote
    but never ended the string with another quote on that line.
    Perhaps you meant to write the backslash character, `\`
    as the last character in the string and forgot that you
    needed to escape it by writing two `\` in a row.
    

(233) Using the backquote character

    You are using the backquote character.
    Either you meant to write a single quote, ', or copied Python 2 code;
    in this latter case, use the function `repr(x)`.

       1: path = "c:\Users\andre"
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    I suspect that you wrote a string that contains
    one backslash character, `\` followed by an uppercase `U`
    and some more characters.
    Python likely interpreted this as indicating the beginning of
    what is known as an escape sequence for special unicode characters.
    To solve the problem, either write a so-called 'raw string'
    by adding the letter `r` as a prefix in
    front of the string, or replace `\U`, by `\\U`.
