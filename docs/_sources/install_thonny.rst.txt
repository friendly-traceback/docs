.. sidebar:: A bit of history

    Starting with version 3.2.5, the creator of Thonny kindly
    included built-in support for
    an early version of friendly. As friendly evolved,
    I suggested that the built-in support be temporarily removed so as to avoid
    any incompatibility; this has happened in newer versions of Thonny.

    In the near future, I hope to add a way to add back some built-in
    support for friendly in Thonny, to complement its built-in
    "Assistant".


Information for Thonny
===============================


`Thonny <https://github.com/thonny/thonny/>`_ is a fantastic
programming environment for learning Python.



Future work
------------

.. todo::

    Ensure that friendly can be integrated within Thonny
    and used to supplement Thonny's own "Assistant".
