About IDLE
=====================

IDLE is often the first program that is used by beginners
learning Python since it is installed with Python.
It includes its own REPL (known as its "shell") and enable
users to write code in editors and run them, with the output
redirected to the shell.

Before Python version 3.10.0a5, IDLE did not allow a user to
define their own "exception hook" to modify the information shown to
a user. Since then, it is possible to have IDLE use a custom
exception hook **except** when dealing with syntax errors.
To get the most out of friendly, **I recommend to use
friendly's own console instead of IDLE's shell** as described
on the next page.
