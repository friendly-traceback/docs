Friendly tracebacks - in English
======================================

Friendly aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
Below, we can find some examples. SyntaxError cases, as well as TabError and
IndentationError cases, are shown in a separate page.
Not all cases handled by friendly are included here.

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     `trb_english.py` located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.

Friendly-traceback version: 0.5.35
Python version: 3.11.0a5

    `ArithmeticError` is the base class for those built-in exceptions

    It is unusual that you are seeing this exception;
    normally, a more specific exception should have been raised.

    `assert condition`, to confirm that `condition` is not `False`,

    If `condition` is `False` or equivalent, an `AssertionError` is raised.

    In Python, variables that are used inside a function are known as

    A variable that is used before it is assigned a value is assumed to
    be defined outside that function; it is known as a `global`

    in the local scope of a function before having assigned it a value.
    
    The name `spam_missing_both` exists in both the global and nonlocal scope.
    This can be rather confusing and is not recommended.
    Depending on which variable you wanted to refer to, you needed to add either
    
        global spam_missing_both
    
    or
    
        nonlocal spam_missing_both

    A `ValueError` indicates that a function or an operation

    The value you gave for the time is not in the format you specified.

    ZeroDivisionError: complex division by zero
    
    A `ZeroDivisionError` occurs when you are attempting to divide a value
    by zero either directly or by using some other mathematical operation.
    
    You are dividing by the following term
    
         zero
    
    which is equal to zero.

    In Python, the keyword `assert` is used in statements of the form
